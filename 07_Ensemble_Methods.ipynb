    "In today's notebook, we're going to cover two of the more powerful and resilient machine learning algorithms used in predictive analytics--**_Random Forests_** and **_Gradient Boosted Trees_**.  These algorithms belong to a class of algorithms called **_Ensemble Methods_**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h3>What are Ensemble Methods?</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods are machine learning algorithms that rely on the \"Wisdom of the Crowd\".  That is, they take the approach that many weak algorithms working together do better than 1 big, monolithic algorithm. In practice, they're often right.  Both of these algorithms create many small, poorly predictive learners that do only slightly better than chance.  However, as we'll see when we begin using them, with enough of these learners voting on the overall prediction, we often get great results, with the added benefit of models that are more resistant to variance in the dataset, and are resistant to overfitting than many other model types (We'll talk about why later).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before using examples in practice, Let's gain some intuition on how each algorithm works.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><h3>Random Forests</h3></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Random Forest_** is a name for a supervised learning method created by Berkeley professor Leo Breiman in 2001, although prior work on this problem had been done by other professors before him (Breiman's white paper available [here](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf)).  The name for this algorithm gives an intuition for how it works--a **_Random Forest_** is just a collection of many small **_Decision Trees_**.  The secret to this algorithm is using **_Bootstrap Aggregation_** (or **_bagging_**, for short) and  **_subspace sampling_**, which is just a fancy way of saying that the algorithm selects random samples from the dataset with replacement (the _bagging_ step), and then selects  a random subset of columns from data ( the _subspace sampling_ step) to use when creating each new \"weak\" Decision Tree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand this model, let's visualize an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pretend that we have a dataset with 10 columns, and thousands of rows.  Our random forest algorithm would start by randomly selecting around 2/3 of the rows, and then randomly selecting 6 columns in the data that it will use to train on (this step is important--the learner does NOT have access to all of the columns for each data point, only a randomly selected subset!).  It will then train it's first **_weak learner_**-- a decision tree that is only allowed to use the 6 columns that were randomly selected. This becomes our first \"tree\" planted in our Random Forest.  The Random Forest algorithm will then repeat this step, sampling another 2/3's of the data, and grabbing another 6 columns from the dataset (recall that the sampling is done with replacement, which means that some of the same data and/or feature columns will likely be chosen again--including an exceedingly small chance that the exact same data/columns will be chosen again!).   After a sufficient number of trees have been created, the algorithm is ready to go!  \n",
    "<br> \n",
    "<center>**_Wait! How Many Trees Should be in my Random Forest?_**</center>\n",
    " \n",
    "The number of trees created for a Random Forest is a parameter specified by the user.  Typically, people tend to use the numbers 10, 30, or 100.  The more trees you have, the more accurate your Random Forest will likely be.  However, this algorithm is subject to _diminishing returns_ for each new tree--that is, each new tree created will add less accuracy than the tree before it.  At some point, adding new trees just takes up more memory without making the accuracy of the model any more predictive.  \n",

This weak learner is then used to make predictions on the remaining data, with the algorithm keeping track of which points it gets right, and which points it gets wrong.  Each data point is given a weight.  The ones that previous learners got wrong will have a high weight, since it is increasingly important to create weak learners that can get this point correct.  Conversely, the \"easy\" data points--the ones that many classifiers can get right--will see their weights shrink.  This is intuitive--if most of our weak learners can a data point right, it isn't that \"hard\", so we shouldn't worry about it too much.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the weight for a given data point, the more likely it is it will be inlcuded in the training set used to create the next weak learner, thereby increasing the chances that a weak learner will be created that can get the \"hard\" data points correct. In this way, the chances of correctly classifying \"hard\" data points will be _boosted_ each round!\n",
